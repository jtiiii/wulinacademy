        history:{
            h1: 'In the 1980s, a group of artists and scholars from China Academy of Art, Zhejiang University, Nankai University, and Xiling Seal Art Society came together to form an independent institution for Chinese arts and cultural studies that echoes to the Imperial Art Academy founded by Emperor Gaozong 800 years ago on the lakeside of Hangzhou.',
            h2: 'In 1995, their vision was implemented by the establishment of the Dazhen Institute of Chinese Studies(DICS) at the ruins of the Imperial Library of Wenlan, standing on the island of Solitary Hill as the predecessor of Wulin Academy. In 1997, as the archaeological excavation at the Imperial Library of Wenlan began, the Institute moved out of the island and cooperated with the Government of Gongshu District to run the Hushu Society of Arts(HSA). Later in the same year, the members of the government left HSA and the institute became independent again as Meilan Society of Arts(MSA). The influence of MSA had grown in art education and Chinese studies as the MSA took efforts to rebuild the connection of the disintegrated Chinese civilization that has been broken off since the New Culture Movement in the mid-1910s and ten years\' Cultural Revolution started in 1966.',
            h3: 'In the spring of 2002, the MSA was given a new name of Wulin Academy of Arts(WA) for Wulin as an ancient name of Hangzhou with puns to the meaning of strength and courage. In the year 2006, the academy moved its location to the shores of the West Lake from the foot of Mount Wu, facing the island of Solitary Hill across the lake that witnessed the tortuous history of Wulin Academy and its visions of the renaissance of Chinese culture.',
