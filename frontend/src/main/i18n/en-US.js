        history:{
            h1: 'In 1980s, a group of artists and scholars from China Academy of Art, Zhejiang University, Nankai University and Xiling Seal Art Society came together to form an independent institution for Chinese art and culture studies that echoes to the Imperial Art Academy founded by Emperor Gaozong 800 years ago on the lakeside of Hangzhou.',
            h2: 'In 1995, their vision was implemented by the establishment of Dazhen Institute of Chinese Studies(DICS) at the ruins of the Imperial Library of Wenlan on the island of Solitary Hill as the predecessor of Wulin Academy. In 1997, as the archaeological excavation at the Imperial Library of Wenlan began and lack of research fundings, the Institute moved out of the island and cooperated with the Government of Gongshu District to run Hushu Society of Arts(HSA). Later in the same year, the members of the institute left HSA and became independent again as Meilan Society of Arts(MSA) to do research and was financially self-sufficient in arts management. The influence of MSA had grown in art creation and Chinese studies as the MSA took efforts to rebuild the connection of the disintegrated Chinese civilization since New Culture Movement in mid 1910s and ten years\' Cultural Revolution started from 1966.',
            h3: 'In the spring of 2002 the MSA was given a new name of Wulin Academy of Arts(WA) for Wulin as an ancient name of Hangzhou with puns to the meaning of strength and courage. In the year 2006, the academy moved its location to the shores of the West Lake from the foot of Mount Wu and facing the Solitary Hill across the lake that witnessed the tortuous history of Wulin Academy and its visions of the renaissance of Chinese culture.',
